# concourse-tasks

These are some sample tasks and a pipeline for translationCore.

## Usage

To get started follow the direction at https://concourse-ci.org/ and deploy the pipeline included in this repository.

However, here's a quick run down:

1. install docker
1. install docker-compose
1. install concourse
1. install fly (download link in your running concourse instance)
1. deploy the pipeline.

Once the pipeline is up and running you just need to log in to the web UI and trigger the task.
